Step 1:- Start.
Step 2:- Collect health-related datasets for diseases like diabetes, and heart disease from sources such as Kaggle.
Step 3:- Clean the data by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables for consistent analysis.
Step 4:- Identify and select important features from the dataset that significantly influence disease predictions, improving model performance.
Step 5:- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, typically in an 80/20 ratio, to validate the modelâ€™s performance on
new data.
Step 6:- Choose machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression for disease classification.
Step 7:- Train the selected machine learning models using the training dataset to allow the model to learn patterns and relationships in the data.
Step 8:- Evaluate the performance of the models on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score to ensure robustness.
Step 9:- Build a front-end interface using the Streamlit framework, enabling users to input health data for disease predictions.
Step 10:- Capture user inputs like age, glucose levels, and blood pressure through the Streamlit interface for processing and prediction.
Step 11:- Process the user input, feed it into the trained models, and predict the probability of diseases such as diabetes,
and heart disease.
Step 12:- Display the predicted disease likelihood and personalized health insights to the user on the interface. 
Step 13:- End.
