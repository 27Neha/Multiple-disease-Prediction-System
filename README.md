# Multiple-disease-Prediction-System 🩺
-This project aims to develop a Multiple Disease Prediction System to assist in the early detection and prevention of critical illnesses like diabetes and heart disease tells the person is (Diabetic or non-Diabetic ), (Heart risk :- Low, Heart risk:- High). The system leverages Machine Learning models such as Support Vector Classifier (SVC),Logistic Regression.
-A web-based application built with Python, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML .

Features
🌟 Disease Prediction
*Supports Two Diseases:
-Heart Disease: Predicts based on parameters like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and age.
-Diabetes: Predicts based on glucose levels, BMI, and age.

⚙️ Machine Learning Models
-Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Accurate classification for disease risk.
-Logistic Regression: Ensures robust predictions.
🛠️ Frameworks and Tools
-Python for backend logic and machine learning models.
-Pickle Framework: Simplifies model access and integration.
-Frontend: Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user-friendly interaction.

💡 User-Friendly Interface
-Login and Registration System: Secure access for users.
*Two Options for Prediction:
-Select Heart Disease or Diabetes for tailored inputs.
-Interactive Input Forms: Guided input collection for accurate predictions.

🌐 Data Analysis & Insights
-Immediate Risk Insights: Get instant feedback on health risks.
-Prevention Tips: Personalized recommendations to reduce risks.

🔍How It Works
-User Registration: Create an account or log in.
-Select Disease: Choose between diabetes or heart disease.
-Provide Health Data: Input required parameters based on the selected disease.
-Get Predictions: View disease risk along with prevention tips.

 💻Technologies Used
-Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
-Frameworks: HTML, CSS, Flask (for backend)
-Machine Learning Models: SVC, Logistic Regression
-Pickle Framework: For saving and loading models
